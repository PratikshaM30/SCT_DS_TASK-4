# SCT_DS_TASK-4
SCT_DS_TASK-4 — Traffic Accident Data Analysis

This project was completed as Task 04 during my Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology.
The task focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of traffic accident data to identify patterns, trends, and factors contributing to road accidents.

📌 Project Objective
To analyze traffic accident data and gain insights into accident severity, vehicle involvement, weather conditions, road conditions, injuries, and fatalities using data analysis and visualization techniques.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Google Colab

📊 Data Preparation & Analysis Steps
Created and structured a clean traffic accident dataset
Loaded the dataset using Excel format for compatibility
Examined dataset structure, column types, and statistical summary
Checked and verified absence of missing value
Performed univariate and bivariate analysis on key variables

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed accident severity distribution
Studied accident frequency by vehicle type
Evaluated impact of weather and road conditions on accidents
Examined relationship between accident severity and number of injuries
Analyzed number of vehicles involved in accidents
Calculated total injuries and fatalities for overall impact assessment

🔍 Key Insights
High and medium severity accidents contribute significantly to injuries
Most accidents occurred during clear weather conditions
Cars were involved in the highest number of accidents
Dry road conditions showed a higher accident frequency compared to wet roads
Higher accident severity levels were associated with increased injuries

📤 Output
Cleaned and structured traffic accident dataset
Multiple visualizations (bar charts, box plots)
Summary statistics for injuries and fatalities
Analytical insights based on real-world traffic scenarios

🧠 Skills Gained
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data cleaning and structurin
Data visualization and interpretation
Drawing insights from real-world datasets
Presenting analytical findings clearly
